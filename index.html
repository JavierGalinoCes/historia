    <h1>History and legends of Barcelona</h1>
    <h2>History:</h2>
    <p>
        Barcelona's history spans 4000 years, from the end of the Neolithic period, with the first remains found in the city's territory, to the present day. The substratum of its inhabitants brings together Iberian, Roman, Jewish, Visigothic, Muslim and Christian peoples. As the capital of Catalonia and the second most important city in Spain, Barcelona has forged its relevance over time, from a small Roman colony to a cosmopolitan city valued internationally for its economy, artistic heritage, culture, sports and social life.
        <br><br>
        There are few traces before the foundation of the city by the Romans in the 1st century BC. The area of the Barcelona plain and surrounding areas preserves remains from the late Neolithic and early Chalcolithic periods. Later, the culture of the Layetans, an Iberian people, developed. The Roman city, founded in the time of Augustus, was a prosperous but small colony. From the 3rd century Christianity was introduced and, between the 5th and 8th centuries, it was part of the Visigothic kingdom. After a brief Muslim occupation, Barcelona entered the orbit of the Carolingian Empire, until it was constituted as a county and became independent in the 10th century.
        <br><br>
        In medieval times, the County of Barcelona acquired pre-eminence over the other Catalan counties and, with the formation of the Crown of Aragon, the city became one of the political, economic, social, cultural and commercial centers of a vast territory that extended throughout the Mediterranean (Catalonia, Aragon, Valencia, the Balearic Islands, Roussillon, Sardinia, Sicily, Naples, Athens and Neopatria).
        <br><br>
        The economic and social crisis of the late medieval period continued to a large extent during the Modern Age: the union of Castile and Aragon in the Hispanic Monarchy led to the transfer of royal power to Castilian lands, which brought a period of certain decadence, aggravated by military conflicts such as the War of the Reapers (1640-1651) or the War of Succession (1701-1714), although from the eighteenth century onwards a period of economic strength began.
        <br><br>
        The nineteenth century was a period of great growth for the city, both demographically, economically and in terms of urban planning. The Ensanche plan and the annexation of several neighboring municipalities led to a great expansion of the urban perimeter. The city underwent a process of industrialization and modernization of its urban, economic and social structures, although, in the social sphere, there was a period of great conflict caused by the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. A cultural renaissance was also experienced and, at the end of the century, modernism emerged as the artistic expression par excellence of the new Barcelona society.
        <br><br>
        The 20th century began with the same political upheavals that ended the previous century, which crystallized in the Civil War. Franco's dictatorship meant a period of certain decadence, although the subsequent arrival of democracy revitalized the city once again. Continuous economic and social progress made Barcelona a city of great relevance in both the Spanish and European contexts, while various social events, such as the 1992 Olympic Games and the Universal Forum of Cultures in 2004, made Barcelona a metropolis of international prestige, an important tourist and cultural center, as well as a thriving financial and congress center.

    <br><h2>Legends:</h2>
    <h3>The cursed train station of Rocafort</h3>
    <p>
        We are not talking about ghost stations, but about ghosts in the subway. Suicides in the subway are already an urban legend (every time the train stops for two minutes, the smart guy on duty tells you that someone has jumped on the tracks and that there is a conspiracy of silence that hides it).
        <br><br>
        And the Rocafort metro station has a dark reputation: there is talk of "a wave of suicides at the end of the sixties" -without giving more data- and that workers see on the monitors people wandering around the platform with the station closed and empty. And that nobody wants to work in that station at night. I called TMB and nobody knows what the hell I was talking about. "But send an email and we'll consult with the most senior people," they told me. The answer could not be more concise: "This urban legend about Rocafort station has no basis to justify it". But what is true is that the station, inaugurated in 1926, served as an air raid shelter from Italian and German bombing and many people died trying to enter a safe space.

    <br><h3>White women slavery in Pelai lingerie shop</h3>
    <p>
        This is my favorite, and totally vintage and autochthonous: don't google it, because you won't find anything (it sounds like an oral record). At the end of the seventies, there was this insane rumor: in a girdle and lingerie store in Pelai street, customers were kidnapped! But only the good-looking ones: when an unwary girl entered the fitting room to see how the outfit looked on her, a secret spring was activated that turned the mirror and gave way to a secret room. Some thugs would put her in a sack, and by means of a system of tunnels they would take the unfortunate beauty to the port: and from there, directly by ship to swell the harem of an Arab sheik.
        <br><br>
        Such was the fame of this hoax that the police came to investigate the matter (and it was concluded that it was a rumor spread by the competition of Fajas La Sirena, that was the name of the cotillería of such bad reputation). The cursed lingerie would have been in Pelai, 26 (today a Bershka).

    <br><h3>The girl in the curve</h3>
    <p>Every self-respecting city with a sharp curve has the urban legend of the ghost hitchhiker. In Girona it is at the exit of Bàscara, in that brutal 90º curve after an infinite straight, where every year more than one fitipaldi is thrown off the bridge. In Barcelona this honor is held by the curve known as La Paella, near the Hospital de la Vall d'Hebrón.
        <br><br>
        Legend has it that if you come back cooked by the Arrabassada road -with the vile purpose of dodging alcohol controls- the hitchhiker White Lady will appear, she will get into your car, and just when you think that at the end, well, hey, you have flirted in the garbage minutes, she will disappear a second before you are crushed by a truck by the hair: "I killed myself in that curve". It's not the same to pick up a girl with dangerous curves than the girl on the curve. But at least you're still alive, you dumbass.
